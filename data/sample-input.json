  "transcriptText": "INTERVIEWER: Can you walk me through a project where you demonstrated leadership?\nCANDIDATE: Sure. At TechCorp I worked with the team on the dashboard product. We had about 8 people and I contributed to the architecture decisions. I helped improve performance—we did some caching and optimized queries.\n\nINTERVIEWER: How would you design a URL shortener?\nCANDIDATE: We'd use a hash map for O(1) lookup. Generate short codes, store the mapping. For scale, we could shard by hash. Redis for cache, database for persistence.\n\nINTERVIEWER: Tell me about a conflict with a teammate.\nCANDIDATE: In that situation, I first listened to their perspective. We had different ideas on the API design. I took ownership of the miscommunication and we aligned on a hybrid approach.",
